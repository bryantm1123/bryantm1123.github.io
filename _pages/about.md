## Introduction

I am a software engineer and technical writer with over eight years of experience, working in startups, scale-ups, and large enterprise companies.

## Skills

As an engineer, my expertise is wide-ranging, from iOS and Android native apps, to backend microservices and REST API design, with a bit of web and content management systems experience. 

I've predominantly worked with Swift, Objective-C, Ruby, Java, and Kotlin programming languages. And I'm familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript, Scala, and Python. I've also worked with XML and HTML markup languages. From an infrastructure perspective, I'm familiar with Postgres databases, [containerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization_(computing)) with Docker and Kubernetes, and [infrastructure-as-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) using Terraform and AWS.

As a technical writer, I've written how-to guides for both technical, and non-technical audiences, for Software-as-a-Service(SaaS) web and mobile apps, and APIs. I'm experienced in Markdown, Wiki, and Confluence-style documentation, and diagramming tools like Miro, Figma, and draw.io. I'm also proficient with the [Docs-as-Code]({% link _pages/tutorials/vscode-workflow/vscode-workflow.md %}) style, leveraging my experience with Git, Markdown, and Github CI, while combining Jekyll to create statically generated sites.

## Timeline

My educational background is in the Humanities, where I studied Philosophy, English literature, and History, ultimately graduating in May of 2016 from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro with a 3.98/4.0 grade point average and Summa Cum Laude with highest honor.

I worked my way through university in various technical support roles, during which time I began building mobile apps, leading to my first professional role at TimeTap in June of 2016.

In 2017, I began working for Duke Energy and built the iOS version of their customer-facing mobile app. And in 2021, I moved with my family to Berlin, Germany to contribute to the digitialization of Germany's public transportation ticketing system with Mobimeo GmbH, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn.
