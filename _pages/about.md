I am a software engineer and technical writer with over eight years of experience, working in startups, scale-ups, and large enterprise companies. 

As an engineer, my expertise is wide-ranging, from iOS and Android native apps, to backend microservices and REST API design, with a bit of web and content management systems experience. 

The predominant programming languages I've worked with include Swift, Objective-C, Ruby, Java, and Kotlin. I'm familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript, Scala, and Python. And I've worked with XML and HTML markup languages. From an infrastructure perspective, I'm familiar with Postgres databases, [containerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization_(computing)) with Docker and Kubernetes, and [infrastructure-as-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) using Terraform and AWS.

As a technical writer, I've written how-to guides for both technical, and non-technical audiences, for Software-as-a-Service(SaaS) web sites, mobile apps, and APIs. I'm experienced in Markdown, Wiki, and Confluence style documentation, as well as diagram tools like Miro, Figma, and draw.io. I'm also experienced with the [Docs-as-Code]({% link _pages/tutorials/vscode-workflow/vscode-workflow.md %}) style, leveraging my previous experience with Git, Markdown, and Github CI, while combining Jekyll to create statically generated sites.

My educational background is in the Humanities, where I studied Philosophy, English literature, and History, ultimately graduating from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro with a 3.98/4.0 grade point average and Summa Cum Laude with highest honor.

I worked my way through university in various technical support roles, during which time I began building mobile apps, leading to my first professional role.

In the intervening years, I've published iOS apps for Charlotte, NC based companies TimeTap and Duke Energy. And in 2021, I moved with my family to Berlin, Germany to contribute to the digitialization of Germany's public transportation ticketing system through Mobimeo GmbH, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn.
