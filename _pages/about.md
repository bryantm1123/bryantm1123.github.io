I am a software engineer and technical writer with over eight years of experience, working in startups, scale-ups, and large enterprise companies. 

As an engineer, my expertise ranges from iOS and Android native apps, to backend microservices in Java and Kotlin. I'm also familiar with Postgres databases and infrastructure as code using Terraform and AWS.

As a technical writer, I'm experienced in Markdown, Wiki, and Confluence style documentation, as well as diagram tools like Miro and Figma. I'm exploring the "Docs as Code" style, leveraging my previous experience with Git, Markdown, and Github CI, while combining Jekyll to create statically generated sites.

My educational background is in the Humanities, where I studied Philosophy, English literature, and History, ultimately graduating from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro with a 3.98/4.0 grade point average and Summa Cum Laude with highest honor.

I worked my way through university in various technical support roles, during which time I began building mobile apps, leading to my first professional role.

In the intervening years, I've published iOS apps for Charlotte, NC based companies TimeTap and Duke Energy. And contributed to the Mobility-as-a-Service iOS and microservices platform for Mobimeo GmbH, a daughter company of Deutsche Bahn.
