This section contains links to samples of my professional writing. Much of my prior documentation work is proprietary, and sadly not sharable. However, there are a few highlights linked below that are publicly available. For more samples of my writing style, see the other sections of this site, my [Github](https://github.com/bryantm1123), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mpbryant) profiles.
