## Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes some general knowledge of the Swift programming language. For an excellent introduction to programming in Swift, please see [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) from Paul Hudson at [hackingwithswift.com](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/).

## What is a Stack?
A stack is a data structure that represents the concept of a physical stack. Items are placed on top of the stack, and the items placed last are the first to be taken off.

Or in pancake terms, you eat one pancake at a time, and starting with the top one. ðŸ˜‹

## A Basic Stack in Swift
Now that we have an idea of what a stack is, let's take a look at a few of its basic features.
- **Push**: adds an item to the top of the stack
- **Pop**: removes an item from the top of the stack
- **Peek**: takes a look to see if there is an item on top of the stack

Let's implement a stack with these features:

```
// 1
public class Stack<Element> {
    // 2
    private var storage = [Element]()
    
    // 3
    public func push(_ element: Element) {
        storage.append(element)
    }
    
    // 4
    @discardableResult
    public func pop() -> Element? {
        storage.popLast()
    }
    
    // 5
    public func peek() -> Element? {
        storage.last
    }
    
    // 6
    public var isEmpty: Bool {
        peek() == nil
    }
}
```

**Step 1**: Create a `Stack` class that accepts a generic type called `Element`. This will allow us to store any type we want in the stack.

**Step 2**: Declare the backing storage, in this case an array. As you may have guessed by the title of the next section, a Swift Array provides features similar to the stack. We'll discuss in the upcoming section why we create the stack instead of using an array directly.

**Step 3**: Push a new element onto the stack by appending it to the end of the storage array.

**Step 4**: Remove the last element and return it by calling the `.popLast()` function of the storage array. We return an optional result here as the array may be empty, and use the `@discardableResult` annotation so the caller can ignore the returned value if it isn't needed.

**Step 5**: Return the last item in the storage array. The returned element is optional again because the array might be empty.

**Step 6**: Add an additional computed boolean variable so the caller can easily check if the stack is empty.

## Why Not Just Use an Array?
While an array is a good choice for the backing storage of our stack, it does not have the *interface* of a stack, which is well-defined in the field of computer science, with the operations of **push**, **pop**, and **peek**. 

Some languages, such as JavaScript and Python, do offer these operations on their collection types, but Swift does not. Therefore, the short answer is, to be a good citizen of the programming community, and to follow a widespread convention that other programmers will recognize, we declare the stack according to the prescribed interface. 

## Let's Start Stack-ing!
### Match the Parentheses
Stacks can be used for certain string validations. Let's say, for example, we have a string that may contain parentheses `()`. We want to ensure that if the string contains an opening parenthesis `(`, it should be followed at some point by a closing parenthesis `)`. We can use the Stack class we created earlier to acheive this.

```
func isValid(str: String) -> Bool {
    // 1
    var stack = Stack<Character>()
    
    // 2
    for char in str {
        // 3
        if char == "(" {
            stack.push(char)
        } else if char == ")" {
            // 4
            if stack.isEmpty {
                return false
            } else {
                stack.pop()
            }
        }
    }
    // 5
    return stack.isEmpty
}
```

**Step 1**: Create an instance of the Stack class with Swift's `Character` type. Hint: In Swift, a `String` type is a collection of `Character` elements.

**Step 2**: Iterate through the string, examining each character.

**Step 3**: If the character is an opening parenthesis `(`, push it onto the stack.

**Step 4**: If the character is a closing parenthesis `)`, check if the stack is empty. If so, return *false*.

If the stack is empty, this means that we have a closing parenthesis with no matching opening parenthesis. 

If the stack is *not* empty, this means we *do* have an opening parenthesis stored there, and we can pop it, as we have found its matching closing parenthesis.

**Step 5**: After we have finished iterating through each character in the string, we return the result of the `isEmpty` check on our stack. 

If the stack is empty, then all parentheses have been matched, and the string is valid.

If the stack is *not* empty, that means we have an unmatched opening parenthesis, and the string is not valid. 

## How does a Stack, Stack Up?
As we have seen, Stacks provide a specific set of functionality, which is well-defined in the programming world. They can also be used with different types of backing storage, for example an Array or a Linked List, but they must always provide the **push**, **pop**, and **peek** operations. 

They can be especially useful in scenarios where *backtracking* is important. For example, if you have a function which navigates a Binary Tree, a stack a can be used to remember the previous decision, and backtrack, or pop that decision, if a course correction is needed. 

Another popular application of a stack is found in Git's [`stash`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash) feature, which allows you to save the state of modified files, without commiting them, and return to an unmodified version of your working directory. When using the command `git stash push`, you are pushing uncommited files onto the stash tool's stack. And to remove them from the stack and back into your working directory, use `git stash pop`.
