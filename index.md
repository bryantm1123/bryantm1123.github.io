# About me
I am a software engineer and technical writer with over eight years of experience, working in small, mid-size, and large companies. As an engineer, I've worked on iOS and Android native apps, and on backend microservices in Java and Kotlin. I'm also familiar with Postgres databases and infrastructure as code using Terraform and AWS.

I studied the Humanities, including Philosophy, English literature, and History, ultimately graduating from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro with a 3.98/4.0 grade point average and Summa Cum Laude with highest honor.

I worked my way through university in various technical support roles, during which time I began building mobile apps, leading to my first professional role.

In the intervening years, I've published iOS apps for Charlotte, NC based companies TimeTap and Duke Energy. And contributed to the Mobility-as-a-Service iOS and microservices platform for Mobimeo GmbH, daughter company of Deutsche Bahn.

## Coding Projects
### The Prisoner's Dilemma
My take on the the classic [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) from game theory. I built this MacOS game with my daughter as a fun way to learn about ethics and decision making.\

### Gifty
Gifty is a demo app for iOS that I built in 2021. It loads a scrolling list of `gif` images sourced from the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint). When tapping an image in the list, a detail screen appears and displays a larger version of the image.\
